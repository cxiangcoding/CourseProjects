This is the client centric consistency model project for course CSE 531: Distributed and Multiprocessor Operating Systems. This code package has been 
tested in Python3.9 on a Mac laptop

0. Install the dependencies: 
   grpcio: python3 -m pip install grpcio
   grpcio-tools: python3 -m pip install grpcio-tools

1. Run "python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. banking.proto" to generate 
   banking_pb2.py and banking_pb2_grpc.py files.  

2. Run the test on the sample input files:
    python3 testmain.py input/monotonic_write.json 
    python3 testmain.py input/read_your_writes.json

3. Verify the output file output.txt 

The code based includes the following files:
banking.proto: define the message types used for gRPC calls. This is compiled using protocol buffer 
branch.py: define the methods that are for clients to use 
customer.py: define customer class and APIs that call gRPC stubs 
input: the input folder containing two test input file for monotonic_write and read_your_writes consistency models, respectively 
testmain.py: the main test entry file 
banking_pb2.py and banking_pb2_grpc.py are the files generated by protocal buffere build 
output: the output folder that contains generated output files
